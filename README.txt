Just a file to tell you what's what.

The calc.exe file is of course for Windows users.

FOR LINUX AND OS X USERS:
The .sh file is for you. You may or may not have to make it an
executable(with administrator privileges, open up a terminal, go into the directory where it's located(run in terminal 'cd /[DIRECTORY WHERE THE DOWNLOAD IS')
for example 'cd /home/Username/Desktop/pythagorean_theorem/' then what you want to do is run 'chmod +x calc' (you may have to use 'sudo chmod +x calc.sh' and then enter the administrator password)

Once it's an executable, run ./calc.sh and you're all set!
